Hooks to set Hestia in Demo mode / disable mode for updating

Place them in /etc/hestiacp/hooks/ if the folder does not exists create the folder!

To do the same with with hestia-nginx or hestia-php

Use the folders:
/etc/hestia/nginx/ and /etc/hestia/php respectively. 

You can still use the same file names.
